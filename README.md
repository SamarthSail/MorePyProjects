# MorePyProjects

### This repo contains small python files that were created for my own python revision/practice of exploring different libraries, trying out different functions, etc. 
### Some of these projects are related to automation but some can also be miscellaneous.
### Each project contains a readme of its own, with its name being the project it is refering to followed by "readme", ex: AutoFileBackup would have a readme of AutoFileBackup-ReadMe
